## About Me
I'm Michelle, an aspiring junior cyber security analyst or software engineer based
in Hertfordshire, UK. I enjoy tinkering and debugging Python code, sharing what I learnt 
and learning new technologies and from others.

## My Projects
### Cyphers - Python
Cyphers is a python application that encodes and decodes the users input by using Caesars cypher principles. It offers the user the option to save the coded message(s) to file for decoding later. (https://github.com/Mich-gui/Cypher_project.git)

### Finance Calculator - Python
This python program is designed to simulate two different financial
calculations, bonds and investments. The user inputs the rate, value and period of time in months to determine projected cost per month for a  home loan repayment plan and the maturity of savings with a locked in interest rate, accumulated in 'simple' or 'compound' interest.

### Holiday cost - Python
A package holiday program which calculates the itinerary for flights, hotel and car rental with options.
